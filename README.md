# kaggle
I participate in Kaggle competitions when I have the time. They have been and continue to be great learning opportunities, but they are also very humbling. In this repository are a series of iPython notebooks that I use to work through these data problems. I don't do a lot of these competitions, but I hope to increase the number over time.
